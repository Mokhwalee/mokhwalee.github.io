I am a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Mathematics and Statistics with a strong foundation in `Machine Learning`, `Optimization`, `Numerical Analysis`, and `Artificial Intelligence`. My PhD research focuses on developing scalable second-order optimization methods, particularly Quasi-Newton (QN) algorithms. I have designed novel low-rank, multi-secant, and limited-memory variants of QN methods to address the challenges of large-scale machine learning tasks, including classification and neural networks. These methods aim to enhance convergence speed and stability while maintaining computational efficiency. For more information and the recent publications, please check my google scholar here: [link](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HzVjkyIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)

In addition to theoretical development, I have hands-on experience applying machine learning techniques to real-world problems across finance, engineering, and e-commerce. My coursework and research have covered a wide range of ML/AI topics, including supervised and unsupervised learning. I integrate these methods into practical solutions, often combining them with numerical optimization tools for more effective performance.

As an R&D Software Engineer at UtopiaCompression, I implemented and deployed combinatorial optimization algorithms, leveraging integer programming and BigCommerce APIs to improve real-time marketplace matching systems. Previously, as a Quantitative Researcher at AlphaCrest Capital Management, I utilized convex optimization and signal processing techniques to analyze financial time-series data and build predictive models for portfolio and risk management.

My goal is to bridge the gap between theory and application by developing robust, interpretable, and scalable ML/AI solutions that address complex problems across diverse domains.
